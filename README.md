Age and Gender Detection

In times of great peril when lock-downs have to be initiated, people, especially children are subject to huge amounts of time with their mobile devices which may lead them towards some unsavoury parts of the world wide web. We have implemented a system that can detect the age of a person who is sitting in front of the device. If this is properly implemented, this can passively improve the mentality of whole generations.

This project has been submitted to hackathon [Hackon 2.0](https://hackon.tech/).
